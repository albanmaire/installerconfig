# installerconfig

`installerconfig` is a highly customizable configuration tool for FreeBSD. This tool is designed to simplify and automate the process of installing and configuring a FreeBSD system, thus reducing the time and effort required to set up a new system.

This one is inspired by what `bsdinstall` does in interractive mode with some additions.
